# nuco

## Description
**nuco is a UI library based on the concept of *Transcends Framework boundaries*.**
It is not bound by UIJS frameworks and is guaranteed to work with all frameworks.

Many major UI libraries today only work with specific UI JS frameworks (React, Vue.js).
Of course that's fine, and that way you can use the framework APIs to provide more complex functionality.
But if you have to change frameworks, you have to let go of those UIs as well.
By specifying this library, we can **mitigate that risk** and **completely separate the pure UI logic from the application logic**.

## Packages
- `@nuco/core`: Provide the look and logic of the UI
- `@nuco/variable`: Manage and provide variables (color theme and color schema) that affect all components
- `@nuco/react`: Wrapped package to run components created with core in the react environment (SSR, CSR)
